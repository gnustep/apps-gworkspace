	* Tools/thumbnailer/GNUmakefile.in: Do not include bundle.make
	since there is no bundle to build.  Including bundle.make with no
	bundle defined caused 'rm -rf' to be executed with no argument
	during make clean by gnustep-make v2.0.6.  Riccardo reported that
	on his system 'rm -rf' with no arguments produces an error,
	aborting 'make clean'.  Hmmm.
